                                        Rezzy is a restaurant reservation template, similar to OpenTable. As it is a template, both the front and back end are currently
                                        accessible. Users can enter their desired reservation date,time, and party size, and will receive a confirmation email if their
                                        reservation can be accomodated. Rezzy uses a SQL database to store and retrieve data along with a PHP backend infrastructure. 
                                        Other features include deleting reservatons and a "Current Reservations" section that shows currently available tables and the 
                                        names and sizes of the parties that are currently eating.<br/><br/>

                                        I initially started out analyzing over 50,000 genocide testimonies in various SQL databases,
                                        searching for reproducible patterns in terms of keywords and interviewee demographics. However, as the SQL analysis stagnated,
                                        I turned to audio analysis. After creating several Python algorithms that identified and charted
                                        silences in audio files, I began using machine learning to find and compare similar sonic trends in an

                                        After my self-started basketball website Naismith Nation was acquired by Holyfield, I was employed
                                        as a writer. Soon after, I was quickly promoted to an editing position due to my detail-oriented authorship
                                        and keen eye for mistakes. I contributed multiple engaging editorials based on data analysis and extrapolation
                                        including a long-form piece on the <a target="_blank" href="http://holyfield.co/20161210the-hot-hand-theory/">

                                        When I first got to Marin Benefits, every new client and their employees would have to be entered into the system
                                        manually. Additionally, each deposit, charge, and withdrawal was also manually input. This tedious and lengthy
                                        process took away time from other important operations and led to many mistakes. I took it upon myself to implement
                                        and manage an electronic data interchange for client and employee information, cutting processing time in half and 
                                        reducing data errors to virtually zero. I assisted in designing a new customer facing website and also created new 
                                        company graphics through Adobe Photoshop.
